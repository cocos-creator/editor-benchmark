The string is a name or title for a spec suite â€“ usually what is being tested.<br>
The function is a block of code that implements the suite.

- **setup**<br>
To help a test suite DRY up any duplicated setup code, provides the global `setup` functions. As the name implies the `setup` function is called once. You can store data in `suite` Object, or define necessary variables. Code from body of the function will be presented in UI.
